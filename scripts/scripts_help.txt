train_scr.py requires one argument, namely "path." This is the filepath to which it should save the model weights and
losses. The weights will be saved to "path_{epoch#}.pt" and losses to "path_{epoch#}_train_losses.pt" and
"path_{epoch#}_val_losses.pt."

val_scr.py requires two arguments, a load path called "path" and a save path called "save_path." The load path should be
of the form "path_{epoch#}.pt," that is, it should include the full file name and extension. Like in train_scr.py, the
save_path does not need file extensions. It will create a file for otes (one time error), another for ttds (time to
divergence), another for tes (total error) and a final one for ges (general error). Optional parameters are described
below.



--batch_size : the number of time series to feed into the model at once. defaults to 1. applies only to train_scr.py.

--delta_t : the size of a time step. defaults to 0.005, so 200 steps is 1 second.

--G : acceleration due to gravity. defaults to 9.81.

-h, --help : throws an error. theoretically ought to show this menu.

--lam : in train_scr.py, the convex parameter lambda to feed into the PINN loss. should be between 0 and 1. higher lam
        weights the physics loss more heavily. defaults to 0.5 for equal weighting.
        in val_scr.py, the parameter that weights how much to penalize errors in theta'. defaults to 1 for equal weight.

--lr : the learning rate. defaults to 1e-3. applies only to train_scr.py.

--max_steps : the maximum number of time steps to sample in each trajectory. defaults to 1. applies only to
              train_scr.py.

--min_steps : the minimum number of time steps to sample in each trajectory. defaults to 1. to sample trajectories of
              fixed length, set this equal to min_steps. applies only to train_scr.py.

--model : the model to train or evaluate. must be either PINN or NODE.

--num_epochs : the number of epochs to run. each epoch is exactly one batch, so num_epochs * batch_size is the number of
               trajectories seen in train_scr.py. in val_scr.py, batch_size is hardcoded to one, so num_epochs is number
               of trajectories seen. defaults to 1000.

--num_steps : the number of time steps to sample in each trajectory. defaults to 1000. applies only to val_scr.py.

--save_every : how many epochs to wait between saving. defaults to 100. weights and losses are saved this frequently.
               applies only to train_scr.py.

--val_every : how often to calculate test loss during training. defaults to 25. applies only to train_scr.py.

--val_size : the number of epochs to run in the validation loop while training. defaults to 100.

--weight_decay : the weight decay. defaults to 1e-4. applies only to train_scr.py.
